    "text": "Success in the Housing Market\nRespondents reported that individuals finding the most success in the Fredericksburg region—for both rental and homeownership—appear to be Virginians migrating in from elsewhere in the state. Fairfax, Loudoun, and other Northern Virginia communities are common origins for these households.\nRepresentatives in Caroline and Stafford also reported that many households seem to be migrating from Richmond or Henrico (for Caroline), and Fredericksburg (for Stafford). Fredericksburg also seems to attract work-from-home households from Northern Virginia.\nHouseholds unchallenged by the housing market—regardless of their origin—also very often have high education levels, according to respondents. The greater incomes for these households usually mean they seek homeownership as their first choice.\nThose lacking success in the housing markets in the region appear to be larger family households (including intergenerational households), and individuals that are working as teachers, social workers, or EMTs. These households struggle to find both rental and homeownership opportunities without being cost-burdened.\nRespondents indicated that starter homes or rental options seem to be limited in today’s market, even for those with the ability to afford such housing. A severe supply shortage prevents these households with more modest incomes from securing housing that meets their needs and preferences.\n\n\nAffordable Housing\nThe lack of rental housing affordable to lower-income workers is felt throughout the region, with the area especially lacking multifamily and senior-focused housing opportunities. Respondents outlined that the housing cost burden for workforce populations continues to increase, which in turn pushes households–—especially renters–—further from their home communities. This exacerbates their already high travel and transportation costs.\nPricing for homeownership options in the region are also on the higher end, inaccessible to those entering the workforce or those looking to downsize. Significant barriers for renters are felt in the landlord requirements for tenants, including large security deposits and credit checks that exclude many of the poorest residents. This has resulted in many families overcrowding units or living in temporary housing solutions like motels for long periods of time.\n\n\nRegional Housing Focus\nBased on the three respondents, it is clear that each community in the region is unique and holds different goals related to housing and workforce development. Loisann’s Hope House serves the whole planning district and finds households that are at risk of homelessness and need support in both rural and urban areas.\nJust as other populations are being pushed farther from home, they report that finding housing to serve their clients (the majority being 30-50% AMI) becomes more challenging and requires casting a wider net. The population and housing market dynamics among localities varies, but so do the goals of each locality as they relate to housing and economic development.\nNonetheless, each locality plays a significant role in serving the housing spectrum of the entire region. While localities may act alone, their local decisions have far reaching impacts outside their local boundaries and will always have consequences for their neighboring communities.",

    "text": "1.2 Gap Analysis Implications\n\nDiverse Stakeholder Recruitment\nDue to the limited scope of engagement conducted thus far, we recommended that any ongoing or future stakeholder recruitment—–in the rollout of this work and beyond–—include diverse professional expertise and experiences. This comprises real estate professionals, employers, and those that work within traditional workforce occupations.\nIt may be valuable to review housing outcomes with stakeholders that live and work in the communities FAAR serves. Additionally, including a diversity of geography to broaden feedback from urban, suburban, and rural communities will be important to more effectively understand the variety of needs across the region and determine how housing challenges cascade across landscapes.\n\n\nEducational Awareness\nUsing data and findings from the housing gap analysis, FAAR could help orchestrate an educational campaign about the opportunities for workforce and economic development to collaborate in the housing field. One example to potentially emulate is Workforce Housing Now, an initiative led by the Community Foundation of Loudoun and Northern Fauquier Counties. They describe the it as\n\n“…a public awareness campaign amplifying Loudoun’s voice for workforce housing as the missing ingredient to our community’s prosperity.” \n\nRespondents reported that the forthcoming housing gap analysis resources could serve as a way to “empower and equip” their communities with greater knowledge. Regionalism could also be a focus of such a campaign to expand awareness and partnerships across fields, like those who are tied to homelessness and economic development. Often these fields work independently of each other and have limited understandings of the challenges facing their respective target populations.\n\n\nApproaches to Regionalism\nThe housing gap analysis will not only need to account for the unique needs and gaps in each locality but also account for the interjurisdictional nature of populations housed in the FAAR region. For example, Loisann’s Hope House serves unhoused and working populations across the region and both economic development authorities interviewed recruit workforce from outside of their home counties.\nWhile many localities aspire to have residents that live and work within their bounds, the reality is that many households will continue to commute or migrate in search of affordable options. The housing gap analysis could be leveraged to call attention to the reality of these differences and to help illuminate missing markets.",

Many housing programs managed by HUD, other public agencies, and nonprofit providers use AMIs to limit eligibility to households with low or moderate incomes. Because wages and living costs vary by market, AMIs help ensure housing assistance reaches those with the most needs.",

    "text": "How AMIs are calculated\nTo calculate AMI, all households1 in a given area are arranged from lowest to highest gross income. The household exactly in the middle has the median income for that given area. We can then refer to any other income value relative to that AMI. For example, if the AMI is $80,000, a household with an income of $40,000 is at 50% AMI.\n1 As described further below, HUD’s official income limits are actually derived from estimates of family incomes.HUD’s process to calculate AMIs for each area across the nation has two major parts:\n\nEstimate the current Median Family Income (MFI)\nUse MFI to generate Very Low-Income, Extremely Low-Income, and Low-Income limits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Family” versus “Household”\n\n\n\nHUD bases its AMIs on the median incomes of families rather than households. The Census Bureau definition for a family refers to a householder living with at least one other person related by birth, marriage, or adoption. Single persons living alone and households with no related individuals are excluded from MFI calculations.\n\n\n\nMedian Family Income\nMFIs are calculated as follows:\n\nData source: HUD uses median family income data from the most recent version of the American Community Survey (ACS), an annual Census Bureau survey completed by 1% of the population. For FY 2024, the latest ACS estimates were from 2022.\nReliability: Because the ACS is based on a sample, HUD tests each the income estimates for each area to determine whether the margin of error is within an acceptable range.\nInflation adjustment: To account for the two-year lag from the ACS sample, HUD adjusts each value according to an inflation factor based on Consumer Price Index (CPI) projections published by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO).\nRound final value: HUD rounds the adjusted median income value to the nearest $100. This result is the official MFI for a given area.\n\n\n\nIncome limit categories\nTo translate the MFI into income values that can be used to determine program eligibility, HUD follows a standard methodology to create new limits for three different income levels:\n\nExtremely Low-Income: Households whose incomes are not above 30% of the MFI\nVery Low-Income: Households whose incomes are not above 50% of the MFI\nLow Income: Households whose incomes are not above 80% of the MFI\n\nFor each of these, HUD generates specific values for household sizes between 1-person and 8-persons.\nVery Low-Income Limits\n\nSet 50% of the MFI as the preliminary 4-person Very Low-Income Limit (VLIL)\nAdjustment VLIL up if:\n\nArea has unusually high housing costs (35% of VLIL is no greater than 85% of annualized 2-bedroom FMR)\nArea has unusually low incomes (VLIL is less than 50% of state’s MFI for non-metro areas)\n\nAdjust VLIL down if:\n\nArea has unusually high incomes (VLIL is greater than 80% of U.S. MFI, and the annualized 2-bedroom FMR is no greater than 30% of VLIL)\n\nCompare change with previous year and apply “ceiling or floor” rules:\n\nMaximum annual increase: 10%\nMinimum annual decrease: 5%\n\nAdjust final VLIL by family size and round up to nearest $50\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2.1: Family size adjustments for number of persons in family\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    1 \n    2 \n    3 \n    4 \n    5 \n    6 \n    7 \n    8 \n  \n \n\n  \n    70% \n    80% \n    90% \n    — \n    108% \n    116% \n    124% \n    132% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLow-Income Limits\n\nMultiply the VLIL by 1.6 (80% divided by 50%) to get preliminary 4-person Low-Income Limit\nRound to the nearest $50\nAdjust down if preliminary value is greater than U.S. MFI (“capped”)\nAdjust up if 85% of annualized 2-bedroom FMR (multiplied by 1.6) is greater than 35% of preliminary value\nApply same “ceiling or floor” rules and family size adjustments used for Very Low-Income Limits\n\nExtremely Low-Income Limits\n\nMultiply the VLIL by 0.6 (30% divided by 50%) to get preliminary 4-person Extremely Low-Income Limit\nRound to the nearest $50\nAdjust by family size\nReplace any values with federal poverty guidelines2 if guideline is higher\n\n2 As published by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS): U.S. Federal Poverty Guidelines (aspe.hhs.gov)\n\n\nIncome limit areas\nHUD calculates AMIs for “income limit areas” that usually align with the Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) definitions published and occasionally revised by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB).3 For FY 2024 AMIs, HUD based its geographies on the delineations provided in OMB Bulletin No. 18-04 from September 2018.\n3 Additional details on OMB definitions can be found here: About Metropolitan and Micropolitan Areas (census.gov)4 Fair Market Rents (FMRs) are also calculated by HUD at the same geographies it provides AMIs. FMRs are used to set payment standards for federal housing assistance programs. For more, see: Fair Market Rents (huduser.gov)However, HUD further subdivides many MSAs into “HUD Metro Fair Market Rent Areas” (HMFAs) that can sometimes be a single county.4 HFMAs can more accurately reflect income and market trends in a community, especially when they are part of very large metro areas like the Washington, D.C. region. If a county is not located in an MSA, HUD will calculate its unique AMI if reliable estimates are available.\nAs of FY 2024, HUD uses four different income limit areas across the six localities included in this study. The table below shows which OMB and HUD designations correspond to each locality.\n\n\n\n\nTable 2.2: OMB and HUD area designations by locality\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    OMB Designation \n    HUD Income Limit Area \n    Locality \n  \n \n\n  \n    Washington-Arlington-Alexandria, DC-VA-MD-WV Metro Area \n    Washington-Arlington-Alexandria, DC-VA-MD HUD Metro FMR Area \n    Fredericksburg city \n  \n  \n   \n   \n    Spotsylvania County \n  \n  \n   \n   \n    Stafford County \n  \n  \n    Non-metro \n    Caroline County, VA \n    Caroline County \n  \n  \n   \n    King George County, VA \n    King George County \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis map shows HUD income limit areas by color for localities in the Fredericksburg and Washington, D.C. regions. The Washington, D.C. MSA is outlined in black.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: HUD FY 2024 Income Limit Areas in Fredericksburg and Washington, D.C. regions\n\n\n\n\nThe Washington-Arlington-Alexandria, DC-VA-MD-WV Metro Area (“Washington, DC MSA”) is a large MSA encompassing the capital and localities in three other states. HUD assigns much of this region to its Washington-Arlington-Alexandria, DC-VA-MD HUD Metro FMR Area (“Washington, DC HMFA”) — including the City of Fredericksburg, Spotsylvania County, and Stafford County.\nAlthough Culpeper County is part of the Washington, D.C. MSA, HUD considers it distinct enough to calculate its own AMI under the Culpeper County, VA HUD Metro FMR Area.\nBecause Caroline5 and King George counties are not part of any MSA (i.e., non-metropolitan), HUD calculates their AMIs separately.\n5 Caroline County was part of the Richmond, VA MSA until OMB Bulletin No. 18-04. HUD incorporated this change beginning with income limits published for FY 2022.\n\nAMIs in the Fredericksburg region\nThe official HUD FY 2024 MFIs that apply to the Fredericksburg region range from $102,000 in Caroline County to $154,700 for the three localities in the Washington, DC HMFA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2: Median family incomes for HUD income limit areas\n\n\n\n\n\nThe chart below shows the actual income limits (at 30%, 50%, and 80% AMI) for each of these four areas, broken down by number of persons in a family.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.3: Area Median Incomes by family size for HUD income limit areas\n\n\n\n\n\nFor King George and the Washington, DC HMFA, note that the 4-person limit at 80% AMI is “capped” at the MFI for the United States. This follows HUD’s methods described above, which adjust the preliminary 4-person Low-Income Limit down if higher than the national MFI. This adjustment ensures that federal housing resources targeted at low-income households are primarily available to those with actual low incomes.\n\n\n\n\nTable 2.3: Capped and uncapped preliminary 4-person Low-Income Limits\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Income limit area \n    Capped \n    Uncapped \n  \n \n\n  \n    Washington-Arlington-Alexandria, DC-VA-MD HMFA \n    $97,800 \n    $123,750 \n  \n  \n    King George County, VA \n    $97,800 \n    $99,200 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe red shaded areas in the chart below are the unofficial “uncapped” 80% AMI limits for these two areas. Uncapped values were calculated following HUD’s methodology for Low-Income Limits, but omitting the comparison and adjustment for the U.S. MFI. The uncapped limits for King George are all no greater than $2,000 of the official capped limits, since its preliminary 4-person Low-Income Limit is very close to the national MFI. That difference is much greater for the Washington, DC HMFA (nearly $26,000), which leads to uncapped limits that defines any household with two or more persons as “low-income” even if they earn six figures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.4: Uncapped Low-Income Limits by family size",

    "text": "2.2 Custom AMIs for GWRC region\nFour different sets of income limits make it difficult to build a universal housing spectrum for the Fredericksburg region. However, we can build custom AMI values by applying HUD’s official methodology to the latest Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) data.\n\nPUMS and PUMAs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is PUMS?\n\n\n\nAlong with a series of published tables with pre-calculated estimates, the Census Bureau provides data from the American Community Survey (ACS) in the Public Use Microdata Sample. PUMS records are anonymized responses at the individual and household level, and are weighted to reflect characteristics of the overall population. Researchers use PUMS to calculate custom tabulations from ACS data that are not available in the standard tables.\n\n\nPUMS data are only available for specific geographies called Public Use Microdata Areas (PUMAs) that contain at least 100,000 people. Localities with large populations are split into multiple PUMAs, while localities with small populations are grouped into single PUMAs.\nThe George Washington Regional Commission (GWRC) officially serves Planning District 16, which includes the following localities:\n\nCity of Fredericksburg\nCaroline County\nKing George County\nSpotsylvania County\nStafford County\n\nPlanning District 16 is composed of two contiguous PUMAs:\n\nGeorge Washington Regional Commission (North) PUMA – Fredericksburg and Stafford\nGeorge Washington Regional Commission (South) PUMA – Caroline, King George, and Spotsylvania\n\nThe map below shows these two PUMAs, along with outlines for other PUMAs in Virginia.6\n6 The Census Bureau updates PUMA geographies following each decennial census. The current boundaries, released in 2022, are based on 2020 census population data. Several PUMAs in Virginia are changed from their 2010 versions; however, the GWRC PUMAs were not altered. Therefore, ACS responses in the 2018-2022 5-year PUMS data for the GWRC region are contiguous, and no adjustments are required.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.5: Public Use Microdata Areas in Virginia\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethods\nUsing PUMS data from these two contiguous PUMAs for the GWRC region, we can calculate new income limits and define household income categories for a regional housing spectrum.\nAt the time of this analysis, the latest sample available are the 2018-2022 ACS 5-year PUMS.7 The steps below outline the methods used to calculate a custom MFI and derived income limits for the GWRC region. The FY 2024 methods published by HUD are used, with the following exceptions:\n7 PUMS data are also available for the 1-year ACS; however, the increased sample size for the 5-year dataset significantly reduces margins of error calculated from the records.\nHigh housing cost adjustments (which use FMR values) and previous year “ceiling or floor” rules are omitted for simplicity. None of the four HUD income limit areas already discussed used these adjustments.\nAdditional income limits are generated at the 100% AMI and 120% levels to help build a complete housing spectrum.\n\nMedian Family Income\n\nFilter PUMS records to relevant entries only:\n\nHousehold-level records; exclude persons in group quarters (SPORDER == 1)\nValid values for family income from past 12 months (FINCP &gt;= 0)\n\nCalculate MFI:\n\nApply housing record replicate weights\nCalculate weighted median of FINCP variable and margin of error for 90% confidence interval (CI)\n\nApply HUD inflation adjustment to update 2022 ACS for FY 2024 (1.062)8\nRound to nearest $100\n\n8 For details on inflation adjustment, see: Methodology for Calculating FY 2024 Medians (huduser.gov)\n\n\n\nTable 2.4: FY 2024 MFI for GWRC region derived from 2018-2022 ACS 5-year PUMS\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Weighted median \n    Inflation adjustment \n    Inflation-adjusted MFI \n    Margin of error (90% CI) \n  \n \n\n  \n    $109,500 \n    × 1.062 \n    $116,300 \n    ± $2,893 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncome Limits\n\nCalculate 4-person Very Low-Income Limit (VLIL)\n\n$116,300 × 0.5 = $58,150\n\nCalculate 4-person Low-Income Limit and round to nearest $50\n\n$58,150 × 1.6 = $93,050\nVerify limit is below U.S. MFI ($93,040 &lt; $97,800)\n\nCalculate 4-person Extremely Low-Income Limit and round to nearest $50\n\n$58,150 × 0.6 = $34,900\n\nCalculate 4-person limits for 100% AMI and 120% AMI and round to nearest $50\n\n100% AMI: $58,150 × 2.0 = $116,300 (same as MFI)\n120% AMI: $58,150 × 2.4 = $139,550\n\nAdjust 4-person limits by family size and round to nearest $50\n\n\n\nResults\nThe table below shows the final income limits by number of persons in the family.\n\n\n\nTable 2.5: Income limits for GWRC region derived from 2018-2022 ACS 5-year PUMS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompared to official AMIs\nThe MFI for Planning District 16 falls in the middle of the official MFIs calculated by HUD for the region’s respective income limit areas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.6: Median Family Incomes for GWRC region and HUD income limit areas\n\n\n\n\n\nThe income limits across family sizes at 30%, 50%, and 80% AMI levels are similarly situated in the middle, even when the capped 80% AMI limits for King George and the Washington, DC HMFA are considered.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.7: AMIs by family size for GWRC region and HUD income limit areas",

    "text": "Income\nBased on 2018-2022 ACS 5-year estimates, there are approximately 385,000 persons living in 132,300 households across the region.1 Over a third (36.1%) of these are high-income households. The next most common group are low-income households (18.4%). All other households with positive incomes are roughly divided even (at 10-13% each) among other income groups.\n1 Persons living in group quarters, such as college dorms and nursing homes, are excluded from this analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: Households by AMI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHouseholds with no income excluded\n\n\n\nFewer than 1,000 households (&lt;1%) did not have a net positive income for the 12 months prior to their survey response. While the housing needs of this small group represent an outsized component of the region’s housing challenges, the small sample of responses prevents reliable estimates from being calculated. As a result, these records are mostly excluded from the remainder of the report.\n\n\nWe can provide a clearer picture of actual household incomes within these AMI groups by plotting their distributions, as shown in the figure below. The overlapping curves demonstrate that while incomes generally increase with higher AMI percentages, there’s significant variation within each group due to the variety of household sizes represented.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: Distribution of household incomes by AMI\n\n\n\n\n\nThis table adds the typical range for each AMI group to its descriptions.2 For example, we now know to associate low-income households with incomes between roughly $50,000 and $90,000.\n2 Here, typical range includes all values between the 10th and 90th percentiles. This removes outliers and reflects the middle 80% of households within each group.\n\n\n\nTable 3.2: Typical household income ranges by AMI\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Income group (AMI) \n    Description \n    Typical range \n  \n \n\n  \n    Above 120% AMI \n    High-income \n    $124,300 - $292,700 \n  \n  \n    100-120% AMI \n    Above-average income \n    $93,000 - $140,000 \n  \n  \n    80-100% AMI \n    Moderate-income \n    $75,000 - $116,000 \n  \n  \n    50-80% AMI \n    Low-income \n    $49,000 - $88,000 \n  \n  \n    30-50% AMI \n    Very low-income \n    $28,600 - $51,500 \n  \n  \n    Below 30% AMI \n    Extremely low-income \n    $3,500 - $28,000 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTenure\nFor every 100 households in the region, 76 own their homes. Of these 76 homeowners, 58 are still making mortgage payments, while 18 have fully paid off their homes. The other 24 out of every 100 households are renters.\nWhile homeownership becomes less common as we move down the income scale, homeowners still outnumber renters in every income group except for extremely low-income households. Of note are the slightly higher shares of homeowners below 50% AMI without mortgages—likely a reflection of seniors on fixed incomes who live in the same homes they purchased over 30 years ago.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.3: Households by AMI and tenure\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHousehold characteristics\nThe most common type of household in the region are those headed by a married (or unmarried) couple. Single persons living alone are the next most common, and make up larger shares of households with incomes below 50% AMI. Single parents with at least one child are also more prevalent among lower-income households.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.4: Households by AMI and type\n\n\n\n\n\nMiddle-aged households—where the average age of primary adults under one roof is between 35 and 64—are the most prevalent age group across every income level. Since these are the prime income-earning years for most adults, middle-aged households are a larger share of higher income households. Conversely, young households and senior/elderly households are more likely to have below-average incomes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.5: Households by AMI and age\n\n\n\n\n\nOnly a third of all households have at least one school-aged child under 18. While this share is fairly consistent across all income levels, households earning between 50% AMI and 120% AMI are slightly more likely to have children than households with the lowest and highest incomes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.6: Households by AMI and number of school-age children\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmployment\nThe majority of adults in the region who are between 25 to 54, and who do not have a disability, are currently employed or looking for work. While another small share are active duty members of the military, any of those adults not actively working or seeking jobs are outside of the labor force. With very little or no income of their own, non-working individuals are much more likely to be part of households below 50% AMI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWho could work, but isn’t?\n\n\n\nAmong persons in extremely and very low-income households who are not in the labor force and do not have a disability, many are probably stay-at-home moms. These individuals are mostly women (83%) who live with at least one earner (80%), and live with at least one child (80%).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.7: Employment status of prime working age non-disabled adults by AMI\n\n\n\n\n\nOnly 18% of all households in the region do not include someone earning income.3 The majority of those are senior or elderly households (76%) with lower incomes. Households with incomes between 30% AMI and 80% AMI are more likely than average to have just a single earner, while double-earner households are increasingly prevalent as incomes go up.\n3 A person is an earner if their total pay from wages and/or self-employment income over the last 12 months is at least $5,000.Higher-income groups also have a noticeable share of households with three or more earners. Many of these multiple-earner households (68%) are families with at least one younger, working adult child still living with parents who have not retired.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.8: Number of earners per household by AMI",

Among renters, single-family homes are the most common type but are not the majority. A large portion of renters live in smaller apartment buildings, with slightly smaller shares in medium and large-sized buildings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.9: Types of homes occupied by households below 30% AMI\n\n\n\n\n\nThe majority of total aggregate income earned by extremely-low income households comes from wages earned from work. This share is larger (70%) for younger renter households who are more likely to be of working age. Among homeowners, nearly equal amounts come from both wages and Social Security, which reflect their higher average ages. Only a small fraction (about 5%) of income for these households comes from public assistance programs.4\n4 This total combines the separate two ACS estimates for Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and for Public assistance programs. The latter includes Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) and other forms of cash benefits. Noncash benefits, such as Food Stamps, are excluded.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.10: Income sources for households below 30% AMI\n\n\n\n\n\nThe amounts households below 30% AMI spend on housing each month highly depends on whether they own or rent. Average homeowner costs are less than $800—with many paying less than $500 monthly—likely due to many seniors who have paid off their mortgages, and now must only pay property taxes and insurance. The average renter, on the other hand, pays more than $1,100 for their apartment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.11: Monthly housing costs for households below 30% AMI\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than 2 in 3 extremely low-income households spend more than 30% of their gross income on basic housing costs. Worse, most of these households are severely cost-burdened—dedicating more than 50% of their income toward housing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.12: Housing affordability for households below 30% AMI",

This means that two-thirds of all workers who live in the region also work within Planning District 16, versus communities outside of the region.\nAdditionally, this data considers those who work remotely from their homes as commuting within the Fredericksburg region. Only 37,711 workers (20% of job holders) travel to Northern Virginia or Washington D.C. for work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.1: Place of work for job holders who live in region\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen considering whole households, most are members in the region’s core workforce: 79,545 households (60.2%) have at least one earner who works around Fredericksburg. Only 23.2% of households in the region consist of both earners leaving for work outside Planning District 16. A smaller share (16.7%), composed mostly of retirees, have no active workers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.2: Households in the core workforce\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommon industries and occupations\nThis core workforce is also primarily represented by people who work at private, for-profit businesses in the region (59.3% of workers). Smaller shares of the core workforce work for government entities, are self employed, or work at non-profits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.3: Class of workers in core workforce\n\n\n\n\n\nRegionally, 36,834 workers are employed in the Retail and Wholesale (15%) and Professional Services (15%) industries. Healthcare and Social Assistance, as well as Public Administration and Military follow behind, and paint a picture for the kind of incomes the core workforce earns.\n\n\n\n\nTable 4.1: Top five most common core workforce industry groups\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Industry group \n    Workers \n    Percent \n  \n \n\n  \n    Retail and Wholesale \n    18,481 \n    15% \n  \n  \n    Professional Services \n    18,353 \n    15% \n  \n  \n    Healthcare and Social Assistance \n    16,261 \n    13% \n  \n  \n    Public Administration and Military \n    15,594 \n    12% \n  \n  \n    Education \n    12,278 \n    10% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcross all industries, the most common professions include Administrative and Clerical Support work, along with Leadership and Management.

However, more than 13,000 core workforce households (17%) have incomes below 50% AMI. A slightly larger share (18%) have low incomes between 50% and 80% AMI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.4: Households by workforce status and AMI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHousehold characteristics\nCore workforce households have similar rates of homeownership compared to non-core workforce households.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.5: Tenure by workforce status\n\n\n\n\n\nAlmost half of all core workforce households are headed by couples who both hold jobs in the region. A large share of those (and 20% of all core workforce households) do not have children under 18. These “Dual-Income No Kids” households (DINKs) often have strong purchasing power in the housing market.\nSingle workers who live on their own account for 12% of households in the core workforce. Single-earner couples with and without children are also common. Working single parents, however, are just under 5% of the core workforce.\n\n\n\n\nTable 4.3: Five most common core workforce household types\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Household type \n    Children \n    Earners \n    Percent \n  \n \n\n  \n    Couple \n    Yes \n    Two \n    23% \n  \n  \n    Couple \n    No \n    Two \n    20% \n  \n  \n    Individual \n    No \n    One \n    12% \n  \n  \n    Couple \n    Yes \n    One \n    8% \n  \n  \n    Couple \n    No \n    One \n    8% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHouseholds in the core workforce have lived in their current homes for similar periods as the non-core workforce, with just under half moving within the last four years. Many non-earner households have lived in their homes for much longer, which corresponds to a significant share of those being older retirees.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.6: Length of time in current home by workforce status\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAffordability\nThe chart below shows the range of typical housing costs for the core workforce compared to other households. Dots represent median values, and lines cover half of all values centered on the median.\nFor incomes above 100% AMI, core workforce households spend similar amounts on housing compared to the non-core workforce. At most incomes below 100% AMI, the core workforce spends slightly less on housing than the non-core workforce.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.7: Housing costs by workforce status and AMI\n\n\n\n\n\nThe core workforce experiences housing cost burden in a pattern similar to the regional averages for each income level. High rents paid by households under 50% AMI are the primary driver of this challenge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.8: Housing affordability for core workforce by AMI",

Just over 25% do not have a mortgage; nearly all of these homeowners have no debt at all.\nFigure 5.1: Owner-occupied homes by mortgage status\nMost homes in the existing supply are single family units with three to four bedrooms, units that could easily accommodate households with upwards of four people and more. Nearly 16,000 units in the region have five bedrooms or more, and fewer than 10,000 homes in the region are sized for families of two people or fewer.\nFigure 5.2: Owner-occupied homes by number of bedrooms\nThe housing stock in the region is predominantly composed of single-family detached homes, which account for about 88% (97,661) of all owner-occupied units. Single-family attached homes represent the second most common structure type with 9,309 units.

Peak activity consistently occurs in late spring/early summer, with notable spikes reaching approximately 1,000 monthly sales in 2020 and 2021. However, the market has experienced a gradual decline in overall volume since 2021, with recent months showing sales levels around 500 units — roughly half the volume seen during the market’s peak periods.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.12: Total monthly home sales\n\n\n\n\n\nThe median time homes spend on the market reveals significant market evolution over the study period. Early 2020 saw homes taking about 30 days to sell, followed by a sharp decline to 5-10 days during the pandemic-driven market acceleration. Since 2022, average days on market in the off seasons has partially returned to pre-pandemic levels, but most homes in the spring of 2024 still sold in fewer than 10 days.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.13: Monthly median days on market\n\n\n\n\n\nMedian home sale prices demonstrate consistent upward momentum throughout the period. Starting from approximately $300,000 in early 2020, prices have risen steadily, with particularly sharp increases during 2021 and 2022. Current median prices hover around $425,000, representing a roughly 40% increase over the four-year period, though the rate of appreciation appears to have moderated in recent months.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.14: Monthly median sales price\n\n\n\n\n\nThe distribution of closing prices across different price segments highlights the market’s structural transformation. In 2020, about 45% of sales occurred below $300,000, while only 5% exceeded $500,000. By 2024, this distribution has shifted dramatically — only 9% of sales fall below $300,000, while approximately 41% of transactions occur above $500,000, reflecting both home price appreciation and changes in the composition of sales activity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.15: Closing price range\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocal markets\nThe distribution of home sales volume across localities reveals stark differences in market size and trajectory. Stafford and Spotsylvania dominate the regional market, each recording over 3,000 annual sales at their peak in 2021. However, both jurisdictions have experienced substantial declines, with current volumes approximately 60% below their peaks. The region’s smaller markets, including Orange, Caroline, King George, and Fredericksburg, demonstrate more modest but still significant reductions, with current annual sales volumes ranging from about 100 to 600 units.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarket velocity, measured by median days on market, shows increasing differentiation between localities over time. While all jurisdictions experienced extremely rapid sales during 2021-2022 with median marketing periods of 5-10 days, recent trends reveal growing disparity. Stafford and Spotsylvania maintain relatively quick sales at 8-10 days, while Orange and Caroline have seen marketing times extend to 20-25 days. King George and Fredericksburg occupy the middle ground with typical marketing periods of 10-13 days.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrice appreciation patterns demonstrate both the region’s overall growth and persistent jurisdictional differences. Stafford leads the market with median prices now exceeding $500,000, representing about 35% appreciation since 2020. The remaining jurisdictions cluster between $350,000 and $450,000, with King George, Fredericksburg, and Spotsylvania showing similar trajectories. Orange and Caroline, while experiencing steady growth, maintain lower price points with current medians near $350,000 and $325,000 respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarket segments\nThe market dynamics between detached homes and townhomes reveal divergent volume trends but similar price trajectories. Annual sales of detached homes peaked near 8,000 units in 2021 before declining sharply to about 1,500 units by early 2024. Townhome sales, while more modest in volume, maintained relatively stable levels around 1,000-1,200 units annually until 2023. Both segments have experienced steady price appreciation, with detached homes rising from about $360,000 to $460,000 and townhomes increasing from $270,000 to $380,000. Marketing times show growing differences, as detached homes now typically require 12 days to sell compared to 6-7 days for townhomes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.16: Sale trends for detached homes and townhomes\n\n\n\n\n\nThe comparison between resale and new construction markets highlights distinct patterns in both volume and buyer behavior. Resale transactions dominated the market with peak volumes exceeding 8,500 units in 2021, while new construction maintained consistent but much lower volumes around 800-1,000 units annually. Marketing periods for new homes have increased dramatically from 10 days in 2021 to nearly 40 days in 2024, while resale properties stabilized at about 10 days. Price trends show new construction commanding a significant premium, with current median prices near $500,000 compared to about $425,000 for resales, though both segments have experienced similar appreciation rates of roughly 30% since 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.17: Sale trends for resales new construction homes",

The remaining localities — Caroline, King George, and Orange — show minimal multifamily permitting activity over the past two decades.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.4: Annual multifamily building permits by locality\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on CoStar data, construction activity for larger multifamily developments has fluctuated considerably since 2015. The number of units under construction peaked in early 2016 at over 1,700 units, followed by another significant surge in early 2019 reaching approximately 1,600 units. Recent quarters show a general downward trend in construction activity, with levels in 2023 falling below 600 units — some of the lowest observed in the time period.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.5: Multifamily units under construction",

    "text": "6.3 Market trends\nThe average asking rent in Fredericksburg has shown distinct patterns between nominal and inflation-adjusted values since 2015. While nominal rents steadily increased from around $1,200 to nearly $1,700 per unit, inflation-adjusted rents remained relatively stable between $1,700 and $1,800 until 2020. A notable spike occurred in 2021-2022, pushing inflation-adjusted rents above $1,900, before declining through 2023 and stabilizing near $1,750 in early 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.6: Average asking rent\n\n\n\n\n\nThis cycle of average asking rents changing roughly $150 from 2021 to 2023 perhaps reflects the influence of COVID-era rental support systems and eviction prevention measures that were available in Virginia. These programs were largely phased out by 2023, with following years showing increased eviction rates and market rents rising.\nThe reduction in rent from 2021 to 2023 could also be attributed to population migration and the rise of remote work in the pandemic era. Many households doubled up, with singles finding roommates or living with family, or households moving from urban areas to rural communities where they can still work remotely and afford rent. As demand reduced for rentals from 2021 to 2023 as a result, increased vacancy rates and reduced competition for units would drive down rents accordingly.\nQuarter-over-quarter changes in average asking rent reveal significant volatility in the market since 2015. The most dramatic increase occurred in mid-2021, when rents jumped by approximately $85 in a single quarter. More recent trends show moderating changes, with quarterly adjustments typically ranging between $10-50 since 2023, suggesting a gradual return to historical patterns of incremental changes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.7: Quarterly change in average asking rent\n\n\n\n\n\nVacancy rates give information about the rental market’s supply-demand balance and the general health of the rental market. Low rental vacancy rates constrain the rental market, making it more difficult for low-income tenants to compete for homes as there are net fewer apartments available. Declining vacancy rates have significant consequences for home affordability, and can highlight supply and demand mismatches.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.8: Rental vacancy rate\n\n\n\n\n\nThrough the COVID-19 pandemic era, rental vacancy rates across the country, including the Fredericksburg region, reached historic lows. The region has hovered around 6% vacancy rate since the pandemic, showing its position within the state as a rural-small market blend among the counties and growing exurbs.\nA deeper examination at the year-to-year percent fluctuations reveals that, while the rental market loosened marginally in 2022 and 2023, with greater availability of rentals at decreasing prices. The most recent signs indicate the market tightening again, with the rental vacancy rate trending downward in 2024 with an estimated percent change in vacancy rate at -0.5%.\nWith the rental vacancy rate sitting near 6% currently, but a decreasing trend in the last four quarters, the region is likely seeing increasing monthly rental costs, as well as decreasing availability of units. This is also a factor that drives up rental prices.",

    "text": "6.4 Dedicated affordable rental housing\nAn array of federal housing assistance programs help low-income residents across the region with rental housing opportunities. Today, there are approximately 6,700 dedicated affordable rental homes found across 78 properties.\nStafford County leads the region with approximately 2,000 federally assisted housing units, followed closely by Fredericksburg City. Spotsylvania maintains a substantial presence with about 1,600 units, while Orange and King George counties have notably smaller inventories of roughly 400 and 350 units respectively. Caroline County has the smallest allocation with 145 units.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.9: Federally assisted units by locality\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program dominates the region’s subsidized housing landscape, accounting for over three-quarters of all units. Section 8 and HUD-insured properties each represent approximately 8-10% of the total inventory. USDA Rural Housing Service (RHS) 515 and HOME programs constitute smaller shares at 4% and 1.4% respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.10: Share of federally assisted units by subsidy type\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIt is important to note that Section 8 described above is not the same as Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers. Section 8 subsidies in the NHPD refer to HUD project-based rental assistance — meaning that they are rental assistance that is tied to a specific development, whereas Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers are tenant-based subsidies that a recipient can take wherever they can find housing.\n\n\nIn addition to those federally-assisted units, there are about 1,500 active Housing Choice Vouchers serving families throughout the region. In some cases, HCVs may be used at LIHTC properties to further lower tenants’ rents. Data is not readily available to determine how many units may have overlap.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.11: Housing Choice Vouchers by locality\n\n\n\n\n\nThe region faces important timing considerations regarding subsidy preservation, with 57% of federally assisted units having subsidies expiring within the next 9 years. Approximately one-quarter of units will reach expiration within 5 years, while an additional third face expiration in the 5-9 year timeframe. Only about 11% of units have subsidies extending beyond 20 years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.12: Percent of federally assisted units by subsidy expiration date",

    "text": "7.1 Overview\nMonthly housing costs show substantial variation across income bands in the Fredericksburg region. Maximum affordable housing costs scale proportionally with Area Median Income (AMI), ranging from about $1,000 monthly for households below 30% AMI to over $4,000 for those above 120% AMI.\nHowever, actual current housing costs demonstrate a compressed range between approximately $1,500 and $2,500 monthly across all income bands, creating particular affordability challenges for lower-income households.\nAs a result of this mismatch, housing cost burdens reveal stark disparities between income groups, with similar patterns varying between core workforce and other households. Among core workforce households, severe cost burdens affect about two-thirds of those below 30% AMI, while an additional 44% of households between 30-50% AMI face moderate cost burdens.\nThe burden decreases significantly for higher income brackets, with only 7-8% of households above 80% AMI experiencing any cost burden. Similar patterns emerge for non-core workforce households, though with notably higher cost burdens in the 80-100% AMI range at 19% compared to 8% for core workforce households.\nFigure 7.1: Housing affordability by AMI",

    "text": "7.2 Rental housing gap\nWage and rent growth patterns across the Fredericksburg region from 2015 to 2024 reveal a concerning dynamic of persistent unaffordability. While both metrics demonstrate parallel upward trajectories, with cumulative increases ranging from 30-50% across localities, this synchronization effectively absorbed most household income gains into housing costs.\nThis pattern is particularly evident in Fredericksburg proper, where the close tracking between wage and rent growth meant that households earning the average annual wage saw minimal improvement in their discretionary income after accounting for housing expenses.\nThe parallel growth trajectories effectively locked in existing affordability challenges, as wage increases that might have provided relief from housing cost burdens were instead captured by proportional rent increases. This dynamic appears most pronounced in urban centers like Fredericksburg and Stafford, where the close coupling between wage and rent growth perpetuated, rather than alleviated, existing patterns of housing stress for cost-burdened households.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.2: Wage growth versus rent growth by locality\n\n\n\n\n\nThe rental housing gap analysis reveals severe shortages for lower-income households in the region. The deficit is most acute for households at 30% AMI or below, with a shortfall of approximately 5,600 affordable units. This shortage gradually diminishes at higher income levels, with about 2,300 units needed for households between 31-50% AMI and roughly 450 units for the 51-80% AMI bracket. In contrast, households above 80% AMI have access to abundant affordable and very affordable rental options, suggesting a significant mismatch between housing supply and the needs of lower-income residents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.3: Rental housing gap by AMI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAffordability categories\n\n\n\nUnaffordable — Housing costs exceed the maximum affordable threshold for that household’s AMI level\nAffordable — Housing costs align with or fall slightly below the household’s AMI level\nVery affordable — Housing costs fall substantially below what the household could afford at their AMI level\n\n\n\nCore workforce rental affordability\n. . .",
