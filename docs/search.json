    "text": "Success in the Housing Market\nRespondents reported that individuals finding the most success in the Fredericksburg region—for both rental and homeownership—appear to be Virginians migrating in from elsewhere in the state. Fairfax, Loudoun, and other Northern Virginia communities are common origins for these households.\nRepresentatives in Caroline and Stafford also reported that many households seem to be migrating from Richmond or Henrico (for Caroline), and Fredericksburg (for Stafford). Fredericksburg also seems to attract work-from-home households from Northern Virginia.\nHouseholds unchallenged by the housing market—regardless of their origin—also very often have high education levels, according to respondents. The greater incomes for these households usually mean they seek homeownership as their first choice.\nThose lacking success in the housing markets in the region appear to be larger family households (including intergenerational households), and individuals that are working as teachers, social workers, or EMTs. These households struggle to find both rental and homeownership opportunities without being cost-burdened.\nRespondents indicated that starter homes or rental options seem to be limited in today’s market, even for those with the ability to afford such housing. A severe supply shortage prevents these households with more modest incomes from securing housing that meets their needs and preferences.\n\n\nAffordable Housing\nThe lack of rental housing affordable to lower-income workers is felt throughout the region, with the area especially lacking multifamily and senior-focused housing opportunities. Respondents outlined that the housing cost burden for workforce populations continues to increase, which in turn pushes households–—especially renters–—further from their home communities. This exacerbates their already high travel and transportation costs.\nPricing for homeownership options in the region are also on the higher end, inaccessible to those entering the workforce or those looking to downsize. Significant barriers for renters are felt in the landlord requirements for tenants, including large security deposits and credit checks that exclude many of the poorest residents. This has resulted in many families overcrowding units or living in temporary housing solutions like motels for long periods of time.\n\n\nRegional Housing Focus\nBased on the three respondents, it is clear that each community in the region is unique and holds different goals related to housing and workforce development. Loisann’s Hope House serves the whole planning district and finds households that are at risk of homelessness and need support in both rural and urban areas.\nJust as other populations are being pushed farther from home, they report that finding housing to serve their clients (the majority being 30-50% AMI) becomes more challenging and requires casting a wider net. The population and housing market dynamics among localities varies, but so do the goals of each locality as they relate to housing and economic development.\nNonetheless, each locality plays a significant role in serving the housing spectrum of the entire region. While localities may act alone, their local decisions have far reaching impacts outside their local boundaries and will always have consequences for their neighboring communities.",

    "text": "1.2 Gap Analysis Implications\n\nDiverse Stakeholder Recruitment\nDue to the limited scope of engagement conducted thus far, we recommended that any ongoing or future stakeholder recruitment—–in the rollout of this work and beyond–—include diverse professional expertise and experiences. This comprises real estate professionals, employers, and those that work within traditional workforce occupations.\nIt may be valuable to review housing outcomes with stakeholders that live and work in the communities FAAR serves. Additionally, including a diversity of geography to broaden feedback from urban, suburban, and rural communities will be important to more effectively understand the variety of needs across the region and determine how housing challenges cascade across landscapes.\n\n\nEducational Awareness\nUsing data and findings from the housing gap analysis, FAAR could help orchestrate an educational campaign about the opportunities for workforce and economic development to collaborate in the housing field. One example to potentially emulate is Workforce Housing Now, an initiative led by the Community Foundation of Loudoun and Northern Fauquier Counties. They describe the it as\n\n“…a public awareness campaign amplifying Loudoun’s voice for workforce housing as the missing ingredient to our community’s prosperity.” \n\nRespondents reported that the forthcoming housing gap analysis resources could serve as a way to “empower and equip” their communities with greater knowledge. Regionalism could also be a focus of such a campaign to expand awareness and partnerships across fields, like those who are tied to homelessness and economic development. Often these fields work independently of each other and have limited understandings of the challenges facing their respective target populations.\n\n\nApproaches to Regionalism\nThe housing gap analysis will not only need to account for the unique needs and gaps in each locality but also account for the interjurisdictional nature of populations housed in the FAAR region. For example, Loisann’s Hope House serves unhoused and working populations across the region and both economic development authorities interviewed recruit workforce from outside of their home counties.\nWhile many localities aspire to have residents that live and work within their bounds, the reality is that many households will continue to commute or migrate in search of affordable options. The housing gap analysis could be leveraged to call attention to the reality of these differences and to help illuminate missing markets.",

Many housing programs managed by HUD, other public agencies, and nonprofit providers use AMIs to limit eligibility to households with low or moderate incomes. Because wages and living costs vary by market, AMIs help ensure housing assistance reaches those with the most needs.",

    "text": "How AMIs are calculated\nTo calculate AMI, all households1 in a given area are arranged from lowest to highest gross income. The household exactly in the middle has the median income for that given area. We can then refer to any other income value relative to that AMI. For example, if the AMI is $80,000, a household with an income of $40,000 is at 50% AMI.\n1 As described further below, HUD’s official income limits are actually derived from estimates of family incomes.HUD’s process to calculate AMIs for each area across the nation has two major parts:\n\nEstimate the current Median Family Income (MFI)\nUse MFI to generate Very Low-Income, Extremely Low-Income, and Low-Income limits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Family” versus “Household”\n\n\n\nHUD bases its AMIs on the median incomes of families rather than households. The Census Bureau definition for a family refers to a householder living with at least one other person related by birth, marriage, or adoption. Single persons living alone and households with no related individuals are excluded from MFI calculations.\n\n\n\nMedian Family Income\nMFIs are calculated as follows:\n\nData source: HUD uses median family income data from the most recent version of the American Community Survey (ACS), an annual Census Bureau survey completed by 1% of the population. For FY 2024, the latest ACS estimates were from 2022.\nReliability: Because the ACS is based on a sample, HUD tests each the income estimates for each area to determine whether the margin of error is within an acceptable range.\nInflation adjustment: To account for the two-year lag from the ACS sample, HUD adjusts each value according to an inflation factor based on Consumer Price Index (CPI) projections published by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO).\nRound final value: HUD rounds the adjusted median income value to the nearest $100. This result is the official MFI for a given area.\n\n\n\nIncome limit categories\nTo translate the MFI into income values that can be used to determine program eligibility, HUD follows a standard methodology to create new limits for three different income levels:\n\nExtremely Low-Income: Households whose incomes are not above 30% of the MFI\nVery Low-Income: Households whose incomes are not above 50% of the MFI\nLow Income: Households whose incomes are not above 80% of the MFI\n\nFor each of these, HUD generates specific values for household sizes between 1-person and 8-persons.\nVery Low-Income Limits\n\nSet 50% of the MFI as the preliminary 4-person Very Low-Income Limit (VLIL)\nAdjustment VLIL up if:\n\nArea has unusually high housing costs (35% of VLIL is no greater than 85% of annualized 2-bedroom FMR)\nArea has unusually low incomes (VLIL is less than 50% of state’s MFI for non-metro areas)\n\nAdjust VLIL down if:\n\nArea has unusually high incomes (VLIL is greater than 80% of U.S. MFI, and the annualized 2-bedroom FMR is no greater than 30% of VLIL)\n\nCompare change with previous year and apply “ceiling or floor” rules:\n\nMaximum annual increase: 10%\nMinimum annual decrease: 5%\n\nAdjust final VLIL by family size and round up to nearest $50\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2.1: Family size adjustments for number of persons in family\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    1 \n    2 \n    3 \n    4 \n    5 \n    6 \n    7 \n    8 \n  \n \n\n  \n    70% \n    80% \n    90% \n    — \n    108% \n    116% \n    124% \n    132% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLow-Income Limits\n\nMultiply the VLIL by 1.6 (80% divided by 50%) to get preliminary 4-person Low-Income Limit\nRound to the nearest $50\nAdjust down if preliminary value is greater than U.S. MFI (“capped”)\nAdjust up if 85% of annualized 2-bedroom FMR (multiplied by 1.6) is greater than 35% of preliminary value\nApply same “ceiling or floor” rules and family size adjustments used for Very Low-Income Limits\n\nExtremely Low-Income Limits\n\nMultiply the VLIL by 0.6 (30% divided by 50%) to get preliminary 4-person Extremely Low-Income Limit\nRound to the nearest $50\nAdjust by family size\nReplace any values with federal poverty guidelines2 if guideline is higher\n\n2 As published by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS): U.S. Federal Poverty Guidelines (aspe.hhs.gov)\n\n\nIncome limit areas\nHUD calculates AMIs for “income limit areas” that usually align with the Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) definitions published and occasionally revised by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB).3 For FY 2024 AMIs, HUD based its geographies on the delineations provided in OMB Bulletin No. 18-04 from September 2018.\n3 Additional details on OMB definitions can be found here: About Metropolitan and Micropolitan Areas (census.gov)4 Fair Market Rents (FMRs) are also calculated by HUD at the same geographies it provides AMIs. FMRs are used to set payment standards for federal housing assistance programs. For more, see: Fair Market Rents (huduser.gov)However, HUD further subdivides many MSAs into “HUD Metro Fair Market Rent Areas” (HMFAs) that can sometimes be a single county.4 HFMAs can more accurately reflect income and market trends in a community, especially when they are part of very large metro areas like the Washington, D.C. region. If a county is not located in an MSA, HUD will calculate its unique AMI if reliable estimates are available.\nAs of FY 2024, HUD uses four different income limit areas across the six localities included in this study. The table below shows which OMB and HUD designations correspond to each locality.\n\n\n\n\nTable 2.2: OMB and HUD area designations by locality\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    OMB Designation \n    HUD Income Limit Area \n    Locality \n  \n \n\n  \n    Washington-Arlington-Alexandria, DC-VA-MD-WV Metro Area \n    Washington-Arlington-Alexandria, DC-VA-MD HUD Metro FMR Area \n    Fredericksburg city \n  \n  \n   \n   \n    Spotsylvania County \n  \n  \n   \n   \n    Stafford County \n  \n  \n    Non-metro \n    Caroline County, VA \n    Caroline County \n  \n  \n   \n    King George County, VA \n    King George County \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis map shows HUD income limit areas by color for localities in the Fredericksburg and Washington, D.C. regions. The Washington, D.C. MSA is outlined in black.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: HUD FY 2024 Income Limit Areas in Fredericksburg and Washington, D.C. regions\n\n\n\n\nThe Washington-Arlington-Alexandria, DC-VA-MD-WV Metro Area (“Washington, DC MSA”) is a large MSA encompassing the capital and localities in three other states. HUD assigns much of this region to its Washington-Arlington-Alexandria, DC-VA-MD HUD Metro FMR Area (“Washington, DC HMFA”) — including the City of Fredericksburg, Spotsylvania County, and Stafford County.\nAlthough Culpeper County is part of the Washington, D.C. MSA, HUD considers it distinct enough to calculate its own AMI under the Culpeper County, VA HUD Metro FMR Area.\nBecause Caroline5 and King George counties are not part of any MSA (i.e., non-metropolitan), HUD calculates their AMIs separately.\n5 Caroline County was part of the Richmond, VA MSA until OMB Bulletin No. 18-04. HUD incorporated this change beginning with income limits published for FY 2022.\n\nAMIs in the Fredericksburg region\nThe official HUD FY 2024 MFIs that apply to the Fredericksburg region range from $102,000 in Caroline County to $154,700 for the three localities in the Washington, DC HMFA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2: Median family incomes for HUD income limit areas\n\n\n\n\n\nThe chart below shows the actual income limits (at 30%, 50%, and 80% AMI) for each of these four areas, broken down by number of persons in a family.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.3: Area Median Incomes by family size for HUD income limit areas\n\n\n\n\n\nFor King George and the Washington, DC HMFA, note that the 4-person limit at 80% AMI is “capped” at the MFI for the United States. This follows HUD’s methods described above, which adjust the preliminary 4-person Low-Income Limit down if higher than the national MFI. This adjustment ensures that federal housing resources targeted at low-income households are primarily available to those with actual low incomes.\n\n\n\n\nTable 2.3: Capped and uncapped preliminary 4-person Low-Income Limits\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Income limit area \n    Capped \n    Uncapped \n  \n \n\n  \n    Washington-Arlington-Alexandria, DC-VA-MD HMFA \n    $97,800 \n    $123,750 \n  \n  \n    King George County, VA \n    $97,800 \n    $99,200 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe red shaded areas in the chart below are the unofficial “uncapped” 80% AMI limits for these two areas. Uncapped values were calculated following HUD’s methodology for Low-Income Limits, but omitting the comparison and adjustment for the U.S. MFI. The uncapped limits for King George are all no greater than $2,000 of the official capped limits, since its preliminary 4-person Low-Income Limit is very close to the national MFI. That difference is much greater for the Washington, DC HMFA (nearly $26,000), which leads to uncapped limits that defines any household with two or more persons as “low-income” even if they earn six figures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.4: Uncapped Low-Income Limits by family size",

    "text": "2.2 Custom AMIs for GWRC region\nFour different sets of income limits make it difficult to build a universal housing spectrum for the Fredericksburg region. However, we can build custom AMI values by applying HUD’s official methodology to the latest Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) data.\n\nPUMS and PUMAs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is PUMS?\n\n\n\nAlong with a series of published tables with pre-calculated estimates, the Census Bureau provides data from the American Community Survey (ACS) in the Public Use Microdata Sample. PUMS records are anonymized responses at the individual and household level, and are weighted to reflect characteristics of the overall population. Researchers use PUMS to calculate custom tabulations from ACS data that are not available in the standard tables.\n\n\nPUMS data are only available for specific geographies called Public Use Microdata Areas (PUMAs) that contain at least 100,000 people. Localities with large populations are split into multiple PUMAs, while localities with small populations are grouped into single PUMAs.\nThe George Washington Regional Commission (GWRC) officially serves Planning District 16, which includes the following localities:\n\nCity of Fredericksburg\nCaroline County\nKing George County\nSpotsylvania County\nStafford County\n\nPlanning District 16 is composed of two contiguous PUMAs:\n\nGeorge Washington Regional Commission (North) PUMA – Fredericksburg and Stafford\nGeorge Washington Regional Commission (South) PUMA – Caroline, King George, and Spotsylvania\n\nThe map below shows these two PUMAs, along with outlines for other PUMAs in Virginia.6\n6 The Census Bureau updates PUMA geographies following each decennial census. The current boundaries, released in 2022, are based on 2020 census population data. Several PUMAs in Virginia are changed from their 2010 versions; however, the GWRC PUMAs were not altered. Therefore, ACS responses in the 2018-2022 5-year PUMS data for the GWRC region are contiguous, and no adjustments are required.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.5: Public Use Microdata Areas in Virginia\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethods\nUsing PUMS data from these two contiguous PUMAs for the GWRC region, we can calculate new income limits and define household income categories for a regional housing spectrum.\nAt the time of this analysis, the latest sample available are the 2018-2022 ACS 5-year PUMS.7 The steps below outline the methods used to calculate a custom MFI and derived income limits for the GWRC region. The FY 2024 methods published by HUD are used, with the following exceptions:\n7 PUMS data are also available for the 1-year ACS; however, the increased sample size for the 5-year dataset significantly reduces margins of error calculated from the records.\nHigh housing cost adjustments (which use FMR values) and previous year “ceiling or floor” rules are omitted for simplicity. None of the four HUD income limit areas already discussed used these adjustments.\nAdditional income limits are generated at the 100% AMI and 120% levels to help build a complete housing spectrum.\n\nMedian Family Income\n\nFilter PUMS records to relevant entries only:\n\nHousehold-level records; exclude persons in group quarters (SPORDER == 1)\nValid values for family income from past 12 months (FINCP &gt;= 0)\n\nCalculate MFI:\n\nApply housing record replicate weights\nCalculate weighted median of FINCP variable and margin of error for 90% confidence interval (CI)\n\nApply HUD inflation adjustment to update 2022 ACS for FY 2024 (1.062)8\nRound to nearest $100\n\n8 For details on inflation adjustment, see: Methodology for Calculating FY 2024 Medians (huduser.gov)\n\n\n\nTable 2.4: FY 2024 MFI for GWRC region derived from 2018-2022 ACS 5-year PUMS\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Weighted median \n    Inflation adjustment \n    Inflation-adjusted MFI \n    Margin of error (90% CI) \n  \n \n\n  \n    $109,500 \n    × 1.062 \n    $116,300 \n    ± $2,893 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncome Limits\n\nCalculate 4-person Very Low-Income Limit (VLIL)\n\n$116,300 × 0.5 = $58,150\n\nCalculate 4-person Low-Income Limit and round to nearest $50\n\n$58,150 × 1.6 = $93,050\nVerify limit is below U.S. MFI ($93,040 &lt; $97,800)\n\nCalculate 4-person Extremely Low-Income Limit and round to nearest $50\n\n$58,150 × 0.6 = $34,900\n\nCalculate 4-person limits for 100% AMI and 120% AMI and round to nearest $50\n\n100% AMI: $58,150 × 2.0 = $116,300 (same as MFI)\n120% AMI: $58,150 × 2.4 = $139,550\n\nAdjust 4-person limits by family size and round to nearest $50\n\n\n\nResults\nThe table below shows the final income limits by number of persons in the family.\n\n\n\nTable 2.5: Income limits for GWRC region derived from 2018-2022 ACS 5-year PUMS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompared to official AMIs\nThe MFI for Planning District 16 falls in the middle of the official MFIs calculated by HUD for the region’s respective income limit areas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.6: Median Family Incomes for GWRC region and HUD income limit areas\n\n\n\n\n\nThe income limits across family sizes at 30%, 50%, and 80% AMI levels are similarly situated in the middle, even when the capped 80% AMI limits for King George and the Washington, DC HMFA are considered.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.7: AMIs by family size for GWRC region and HUD income limit areas",

    "text": "Income\nBased on 2018-2022 ACS 5-year estimates, there are approximately 385,000 persons living in 132,300 households across the region.1 Over a third (36.1%) of these are high-income households. The next most common group are low-income households (18.4%). All other households with positive incomes are roughly divided even (at 10-13% each) among other income groups.\n1 Persons living in group quarters, such as college dorms and nursing homes, are excluded from this analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: Households by AMI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHouseholds with no income excluded\n\n\n\nFewer than 1,000 households (&lt;1%) did not have a net positive income for the 12 months prior to their survey response. While the housing needs of this small group represent an outsized component of the region’s housing challenges, the small sample of responses prevents reliable estimates from being calculated. As a result, these records are mostly excluded from the remainder of the report.\n\n\nWe can provide a clearer picture of actual household incomes within these AMI groups by plotting their distributions, as shown in the figure below. The overlapping curves demonstrate that while incomes generally increase with higher AMI percentages, there’s significant variation within each group due to the variety of household sizes represented.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: Distribution of household incomes by AMI\n\n\n\n\n\nThis table adds the typical range for each AMI group to its descriptions.2 For example, we now know to associate low-income households with incomes between roughly $50,000 and $90,000.\n2 Here, typical range includes all values between the 10th and 90th percentiles. This removes outliers and reflects the middle 80% of households within each group.\n\n\n\nTable 3.2: Typical household income ranges by AMI\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Income group (AMI) \n    Description \n    Typical range \n  \n \n\n  \n    Above 120% AMI \n    High-income \n    $124,300 - $292,700 \n  \n  \n    100-120% AMI \n    Above-average income \n    $93,000 - $140,000 \n  \n  \n    80-100% AMI \n    Moderate-income \n    $75,000 - $116,000 \n  \n  \n    50-80% AMI \n    Low-income \n    $49,000 - $88,000 \n  \n  \n    30-50% AMI \n    Very low-income \n    $28,600 - $51,500 \n  \n  \n    Below 30% AMI \n    Extremely low-income \n    $3,500 - $28,000 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTenure\nFor every 100 households in the region, 76 own their homes. Of these 76 homeowners, 58 are still making mortgage payments, while 18 have fully paid off their homes. The other 24 out of every 100 households are renters.\nWhile homeownership becomes less common as we move down the income scale, homeowners still outnumber renters in every income group except for extremely low-income households. Of note are the slightly higher shares of homeowners below 50% AMI without mortgages—likely a reflection of seniors on fixed incomes who live in the same homes they purchased over 30 years ago.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.3: Households by AMI and tenure\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHousehold characteristics\nThe most common type of household in the region are those headed by a married (or unmarried) couple. Single persons living alone are the next most common, and make up larger shares of households with incomes below 50% AMI. Single parents with at least one child are also more prevalent among lower-income households.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.4: Households by AMI and type\n\n\n\n\n\nMiddle-aged households—where the average age of primary adults under one roof is between 35 and 64—are the most prevalent age group across every income level. Since these are the prime income-earning years for most adults, middle-aged households are a larger share of higher income households. Conversely, young households and senior/elderly households are more likely to have below-average incomes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.5: Households by AMI and age\n\n\n\n\n\nOnly a third of all households have at least one school-aged child under 18. While this share is fairly consistent across all income levels, households earning between 50% AMI and 120% AMI are slightly more likely to have children than households with the lowest and highest incomes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.6: Households by AMI and number of school-age children\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmployment\nThe majority of adults in the region who are between 25 to 54, and who do not have a disability, are currently employed or looking for work. While another small share are active duty members of the military, any of those adults not actively working or seeking jobs are outside of the labor force. With very little or no income of their own, non-working individuals are much more likely to be part of households below 50% AMI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWho could work, but isn’t?\n\n\n\nAmong persons in extremely and very low-income households who are not in the labor force and do not have a disability, many are probably stay-at-home moms. These individuals are mostly women (83%) who live with at least one earner (80%), and live with at least one child (80%).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.7: Employment status of prime working age non-disabled adults by AMI\n\n\n\n\n\nOnly 18% of all households in the region do not include someone earning income.3 The majority of those are senior or elderly households (76%) with lower incomes. Households with incomes between 30% AMI and 80% AMI are more likely than average to have just a single earner, while double-earner households are increasingly prevalent as incomes go up.\n3 A person is an earner if their total pay from wages and/or self-employment income over the last 12 months is at least $5,000.Higher-income groups also have a noticeable share of households with three or more earners. Many of these multiple-earner households (68%) are families with at least one younger, working adult child still living with parents who have not retired.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.8: Number of earners per household by AMI",

Among renters, single-family homes are the most common type but are not the majority. A large portion of renters live in smaller apartment buildings, with slightly smaller shares in medium and large-sized buildings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.9: Types of homes occupied by households below 30% AMI\n\n\n\n\n\nThe majority of total aggregate income earned by extremely-low income households comes from wages earned from work. This share is larger (70%) for younger renter households who are more likely to be of working age. Among homeowners, nearly equal amounts come from both wages and Social Security, which reflect their higher average ages. Only a small fraction (about 5%) of income for these households comes from public assistance programs.4\n4 This total combines the separate two ACS estimates for Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and for Public assistance programs. The latter includes Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) and other forms of cash benefits. Noncash benefits, such as Food Stamps, are excluded.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.10: Income sources for households below 30% AMI\n\n\n\n\n\nThe amounts households below 30% AMI spend on housing each month highly depends on whether they own or rent. Average homeowner costs are less than $800—with many paying less than $500 monthly—likely due to many seniors who have paid off their mortgages, and now must only pay property taxes and insurance. The average renter, on the other hand, pays more than $1,100 for their apartment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.11: Monthly housing costs for households below 30% AMI\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than 2 in 3 extremely low-income households spend more than 30% of their gross income on basic housing costs. Worse, most of these households are severely cost-burdened—dedicating more than 50% of their income toward housing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.12: Housing affordability for households below 30% AMI",
