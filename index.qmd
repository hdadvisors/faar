This study is a regional housing gap analysis conducted by [HDAdvisors](https://www.hdadvisors.net) (HDA) for the [Fredericksburg Area Association of REALTORS®](https://www.faarmembers.com/) (FAAR). The study has four objectives:

* Frame workforce housing needs within the context of the region’s full housing spectrum,
* Assess the housing affordability landscape for the workforce, with specific focus on workers whose homes and jobs are within the region,
* Determine what types, locations, and prices of homes best meet the needs of current and projected workers, and
* Present results at both the regional and local levels with fact sheets and other deliverables that can be easily disseminated and consumed by multiple audiences.
