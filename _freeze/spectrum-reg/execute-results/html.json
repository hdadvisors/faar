It includes assessments of households in the region by various demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, primarily by wages/income. Special analysis for the region's core workforce (i.e. persons both living and working within the region) can be found in @sec-spectrum-work.\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n### How AMIs and the \"region\" are defined\n\nThe Area Median Income (AMI) categories in the regional housing spectrum are custom limits developed from the same methods used by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Because HUD does not publish official limits for *just* the Fredercksburg region, new AMIs were calculated using the latest available microdata from the American Community Survey (ACS).\n\nACS microdata are available at the same geography served by the George Washington Regional Commission (GWRC), known officially as *Planning District 16*. The five localities in this area include:\n\n* City of Fredericksburg\n* Caroline County\n* King George County\n* Spotsylvania County\n* Stafford County\n\nTogether, these jurisdictions are collectively referred to as \"the region\" throughout the report.\n\n*See @sec-data-notes for a detailed explainer on HUD AMIs and the specific methods used to generate custom income limits for the region.*\n:::\n\n## Overview\n\nWith few exceptions, housing opportunities are primarily limited by how much money a household has available to buy or rent a home. To create a regional housing spectrum, we first need to group households according to their incomes. The categories used here, along with their respective plain-language descriptions, are shown below.\n\n\n\n\n::: {#tbl-ami-labels .cell layout-align=\"left\" tbl-cap='Housing spectrum income group categories'}\n::: {.cell-output-display  html-table-processing=none}\n`````{=html}\n<table class=\"table table-condensed table-striped\" style=\"width: auto !important; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Income group </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> Description </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Above 120% AMI </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;font-style: italic;\"> High-income </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 100-120% AMI </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;font-style: italic;\"> Above-average income </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 80-100% AMI </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;font-style: italic;\"> Moderate-income </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 50-80% AMI </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;font-style: italic;\"> Low-income </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 30-50% AMI </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;font-style: italic;\"> Very low-income </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Below 30% AMI </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;font-style: italic;\"> Extremely low-income </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Zero or negative income </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;font-style: italic;\"> No income </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### Income\n\nBased on 2018-2022 ACS 5-year estimates, there are approximately 385,000 persons living in 132,300 households across the region.[^gq] Over a third (36.1%) of these are high-income households. The next most common group are low-income households (18.4%). All other households with positive incomes are roughly divided even (at 10-13% each) among other income groups.\n\n[^gq]: Persons living in *group quarters*, such as college dorms and nursing homes, are excluded from this analysis.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"left\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Households by AMI category](spectrum-reg_files/figure-html/fig-ami-1.png){#fig-ami fig-align='left' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n### No income households excluded\n\nFewer than 1,000 households (<1%) reported no income for the 12 months prior to their survey response. While the housing needs of this small group represent an outsized component of the region's housing challenges, the small sample of responses prevents reliable estimates from being calculated. As a result, these records are mostly excluded from the remainder of the report.\n:::\n\n### Tenure\n\n...\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"left\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Households by AMI and tenure](spectrum-reg_files/figure-html/fig-ami-tenure-1.png){#fig-ami-tenure fig-align='left' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n",
