This includes all households where at least one member is employed at a job also located within the region. \n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n### Defining the \"core workforce\"\n\nFor every record of an employed person, the Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) includes a variable for the place-of-work Public Use Microdata Area (\"POWPUMA\"). Households with at least one person who has worked in the last 12 months *and* whose POWPUMA values correspond to the Fredericksburg area (Planning District 16) were designated as members of the core workforce.\n\nEmployed persons who work from home are included in this group.\n:::\n\n## Overview\n\n### Identifying the core workforce\n\nBased on this definition, 125,312 workers are both employed and live in the region. This means that two-thirds of all workers who live in the region also work within Planning District 16, versus communities outside of the region.\n\nAdditionally, this data considers those who work remotely from their homes as commuting within the Fredericksburg region. Only 37,711 workers (20% of job holders) travel to Northern Virginia or Washington D.C. for work. \n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"left\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Place of work for job holders who live in region](spectrum-work_files/figure-html/fig-pow-jobs-1.png){#fig-pow-jobs fig-align='left' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nWhen considering whole households, most are members in the regionâ€™s core workforce: 79,545 households (60.2%) have at least one earner who works around Fredericksburg. Only 23.2% of households in the region consist of both earners leaving for work outside Planning District 16. A smaller share (16.7%), composed mostly of retirees, have no active workers.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"left\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Households in the core workforce](spectrum-work_files/figure-html/fig-wf-hh-1.png){#fig-wf-hh fig-align='left' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### Common industries and occupations\n\nThis core workforce is also primarily represented by people who work at private, for-profit businesses in the region (59.3% of workers).
